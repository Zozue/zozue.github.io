## Profile

Josh Loke is a prospective software developer with a materials engineering background.

Josh graduated from the B.Eng Materials Engineering Co-op at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, during which he obtained a total of 1 year of engineering co-op experience with 4 months at Infasco and 8 months at JFE Steel. At these placements, he learned valuable material characterization techniques, 3D modelling skills, research protocols and how to run complex physics simulations.

After graduation, he was a Production Support Analyst at Morgan Stanley for 2 years, where he worked closely with both the developers and the operation teams to ensure the production environment was running smoothly. There, he supported a number of internally developed collateral management and margin call applications.

At Morgan Stanley, he had the opportunity to work with technologies such as Sybase SQL servers, IBM DB2 SQL servers, Unix administration, bash and ksh shell scripting, python, javascript, and more.

After 2 years at Morgan Stanley, Josh decided to further his software development skillset by joining FDM Groups Java Development training.
